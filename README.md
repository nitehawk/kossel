Release status
==============

Just starting work on the KosselHawk derivitive.
Plans:
- Increased build volume option
- Wheel based linear motion utilizing the slot built into the aluminum extrusion
- SCAD models adjusted to be more parametric in relation to the extrusion options

Considering:
- Multiple hot end option
  - Currently thinking that this will be a maximum of 2 hot ends to avoid further complicating the electronics.
  - RAMPS 1.4 has built-in support for 5 steppers, which would allow for 2 hot ends to be driven
  - Ideally the end effector platform will be mostly interchangable
    - May require different length rods to accommidate the size change.
- Secondary vertical towers to provide additional strength and additional places to mount filament spools, etc.

How to print KosselHawk
========================

* 3x plate_3x.stl (about 3x80g = 240g of plastic)

Pay it forward
==============

Note:   Pay it forward is for the Primary mini kossel project located at:
  https://github.com/jcrocholl/kossel

No current plans to manage a pay it forward option on the KosselHawk derivitive.

Johann is offering free printed parts for Mini Kossel:

* I'm going to make some Mini Kossel printed parts kits.
* I'm going to give them away for free (as in beer).
* Some kits may include some non-printed parts.
* Free international shipping is included.
* No delivery schedule, maybe only one kit per month.

But there's no such thing as a free lunch. If you want to receive a
free kit, you must swear by your geek honor:

* To complete your Mini Kossel and tune it well.
* To print two (2) Mini Kossel kits and also give them away for free.
* To make your recipients agree to the same rule.

After giving away the 2 free kits, you may sell printed parts for any
price you want.

If you're interested, please email johann@rocholl.net and let me know
your favorite PLA color and mailing address. If you want to get your
printed parts first, explain why you're more qualified than others to
start giving away high quality printed parts soon.
